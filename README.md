# PySIFT

This project contains an implementation of the SIFT keypoint extraction algorithm in Python. For a detailed explanation, visit the following blog post: https://medium.com/@lerner98/implementing-sift-in-python-36c619df7945.

## Warning

I do not maintain this repository. The code is provided as-is, so if you encounter an issue (which is likely) I would advise you to try and fix it yourself.

Also, if anyone wants to maintain this repository, leave an issue and I will gladly add you as a collaborator or transfer ownership.

## Limitations 

The code is unoptimized. This means that I took time to implement each step of SIFT as described in the paper as faithfully as I could but I did not do a second pass over the implementation for optimization. Therefore, on any reasonably-sized image, it should be fairly slow.
